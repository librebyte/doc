**Bounce.js** is a tool and JS library for generating beautiful CSS3 powered keyframe animations. The tool on bouncejs.com allows you to generate static keyframes that can be used without any extra JavaScript, but if you'd like your application to generate these on the fly, you can use the Bounce.js library.
