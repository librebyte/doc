While you should always validate data on your servers, additional validation of data on the Web page itself has multiple benefits. In many ways, users are annoyed by forms. By validating form data while the user is filling it out, the user can know immediately if they've made any mistakes; this saves the time of waiting for an HTTP response and saves your server from dealing with bad form input. This article covers how to validate form data within your form's Web content.
