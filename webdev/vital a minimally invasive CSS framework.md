A minimally invasive CSS framework for modern web applications.

- Flexible: Vital is built with Sass, the preferred CSS preprocessor of today.
- Readable: No ridiculous amounts of classes or nesting. No excessively buried code.
- Scalable: Written almost entirely in emvalues, allowing for easy and consistent scaling.
