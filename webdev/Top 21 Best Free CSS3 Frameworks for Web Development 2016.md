According Wikipedia:

> CSS frameworks are pre-prepared software frameworks that are meant to allow for easier, more standards-compliant web design using the Cascading Style Sheets language. Most of these frameworks contain at least a grid. More functional frameworks also come with more features and additional JavaScript based functions, but are mostly design oriented and unobtrusive.

Here a wonderful list of Free/Libre CSS frameworks compiled by colorlib.

Note: I can't find the source code for Sculpt framework, may be it's not Free/Libre anymore but seems that was at the time of the post was written.
