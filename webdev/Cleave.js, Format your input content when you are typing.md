The idea is to provide an easy way to increase input field readability by formatting your typed data. By using this library, you won't need to write any mind-blowing regular expressions or mask patterns to format input text.

Features

* Credit card number formatting
* Phone number formatting (i18n js lib separated for each country to reduce size)
* Date formatting
