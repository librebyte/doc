Tailwind is different from frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, or Bulma in that it's not a UI kit.

It doesn't have a default theme, and there are no built-in UI components.

On the flip side, it also has no opinion about how your site should look and doesn't impose design decisions that you have to fight to undo.

If you're looking for a framework that comes with a menu of predesigned widgets to build your site with, Tailwind might not be the right framework for you.

But if you want a huge head start implementing a custom design with its own identity, Tailwind might be just what you're looking for.
