Alignment and Distribution of Objects This section describes the Align and Distribute dialog (Object â†’ Align and Distribute... (Shift+Ctrl+A)) which allows the positioning of objects with respect to other objects or to the selection, drawing, or page. Two types of positioning are available: alignment where the centers or edges of objects are aligned to one another, and distributing where objects are distributed in some direction based on their centers or edges.
