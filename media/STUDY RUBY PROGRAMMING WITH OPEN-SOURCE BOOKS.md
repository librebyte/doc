**Ruby** is a general purpose, scripting, structured, flexible, fully object-oriented programming language developed by Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto. It features a fully dynamic type system, which means that the majority of its type checking is performed at run-time rather than at compilation... This compilation makes 9 strong recommendations.
