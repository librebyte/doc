Inkscape, Guide to a Vector Drawing Program is the guide to the Inkscape program. The web-based version is linked directly under the program's Help menu. This book is both an introduction and reference for the Inkscape drawing program. With Inkscape, one can produce a wide variety of art, from photo-realistic drawings to organizational charts. Inkscape uses SVG, a powerful vector-based drawing language and W3C web standard, as its native format. SVG drawings can be directly viewed by all the major web browsers including Firefox, Opera, Safari, Chrome and Edge. With the advent of HTML5, SVG is easily embedded in web pages. Inkscape is available free for Windows, Macintosh, and Linux operating systems. The first third of the book is devoted to eight tutorials that progress in difficulty from very basic to very complex (three additional tutorials were written explicitly for the PDF and print versions). The remainder of the book covers each facet of Inkscape in detail. Updated for Inkscape v0.92 and v0.93, the book includes complete coverage of new features including: new Mesh tool, updated Text tool with font features, and many new extensions. Advance topics covered include the use of Inkscape's powerful tiling tool, built-in bitmap tracing, and SVG use on the Web including in HTML5. The book includes plenty of tips (and warnings) about the use of Inkscape and SVG.
