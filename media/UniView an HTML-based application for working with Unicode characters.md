UniView is an HTML-based application for working with Unicode characters. You can look up or find characters (using graphics or fonts) and related information, view whole character blocks or custom ranges, select characters to paste into your document, paste in and discover unknown characters, search for characters using regular expressions, do hex/dec/ncr conversions, highlight character types, etc. etc. It supports Unicode 10.0 and is written with Web Standards to work on a variety of browsers.
