**cmus** is a fast and flexible music player. It organizes your music by either musician or album title, and lets you load playlist files. You can also use cmus' built-in search function to look for music in your /home directory and you can switch between several different layouts.
**MOC** (short for Music on Console) is a dual-pane music player that's similar to cmus. The left pane lists the tracks in a folder, while the right pane contains the contents of a playlist file (if there is one in the folder).
The **mpg123** distribution contains a real time MPEG 1.0/2.0/2.5 audio player/decoder for layers 1,2 and 3 (most commonly MPEG 1.0 layer 3 aka MP3), as well as re-usable decoding and output libraries.
