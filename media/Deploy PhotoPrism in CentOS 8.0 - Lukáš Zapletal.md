PhotoPrism is a great web photo library which can be deployed at your home. It has some unique features like tagging photo using TensorFlow, however the most appealing features for me are slick interface, easy use and administration, support for RAW/HEIC formats (reading), ability to configure “read only” mode (my originals are never touched) and “photo stream” approach (all photos in one huge pile with search/tagging capabilities).
