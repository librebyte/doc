> Arch Linux by default does not come with a GUI tool for updating packages or working with the AUR (Arch User Repository), and this is just fine for most Arch users. However, having used Manjaro for quite a while fairly recently, I kind of got used to using Pamac as a GUI option for these things when I didn't feel like mucking around with a terminal.
