 In GNOME 40, Epiphany will feature a new tab bar. This isn’t just a restyling of the old one, but a ground-up rewrite. But why was this needed?

Static vs dynamic GNOME apps use tabs in a lot of different ways, but they can be roughly divided into two categories. I will refer to them as static and dynamic tabs.
