> There aren't much theme development going on for Ubuntu 16.10 Yakkety but there are still people who are doing their jobs behind the scene for you to make your desktop as fancy as possible. Since in Ubuntu 16.10 changed a lot and it takes a lot of time to rewrite the theme from scratch. Dark Aurora theme isn't dark but it looks great and it is available for Gnome Shell, Unity, Cinnamon, Xfce and compatible also with other desktops.
