> A splash screen is nothing but the picture that's gets displayed in the background while booting the Linux operating system. You might be knowing that Grub (GRand Unified Bootloader) is the commonly used famous bootloader among major Linux distributions. If you take Redhat as an example, it displays a blank or black background during the booting of the system.
