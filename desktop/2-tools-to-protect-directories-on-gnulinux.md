LinuxAndUbuntu explains how to protect directories using Cryptkeeper and Gnome Encfs Manage tools.

**Cryptkeeper** is a Linux system tray applet that manages EncFS encrypted folders.

The **Gnome Encfs Manager** (or short GEncfsM) is an easy to use manager and mounter for encfs stashes featuring per-stash configuration, Gnome Keyring support, a tray menu inspired by Cryptkeeper and lots of unique features.

**EncFS** is a Free (LGPL) FUSE-based cryptographic filesystem. It transparently encrypts files, using an arbitrary directory as storage for the encrypted files.
