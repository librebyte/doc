> Unity is the default desktop interface for Ubuntu, many people like it and many don’t, for those who don’t like it, we’ll explain to you how to completely remove Unity from Ubuntu and install Cinnamon and MATE interfaces easily.

**Unity** and its range of technologies brings simplicity, power, and integration to both users and application developers. Unity puts design, integration, and Free Software at the heart of delivering a powerfull and attractive experience.

**Cinnamon** is a desktop environment that is based on the GTK+ 3 toolkit. It was released in 2011. Cinnamon originally started as a fork of GNOME Shell, thus initially as a mere graphical shell of the GNOME software, but became its own desktop environment in Cinnamon 2.0.

**The MATE Desktop Environment** is the continuation of GNOME 2. It provides an intuitive and attractive desktop environment using traditional metaphors for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.
