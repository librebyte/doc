This installer provides a really easy way of installing a signed certificate with Letâ€™s Encrypt for an Apache server.

* DOMAIN is the URL to access from outside and inside your house. Use the same one you signed up with no-ip.org or any other DDNS provider. Your website must be accessible from the internet.
* EMAIL in case ISRG has to contact you.
