> In case you haven't realized already, encryption is important. For the web, that means using SSL certificates to secure web traffic. Recently, Mozilla and Google have gone as far as to mark sites without SSL certificates as insecure in Firefox and Chrome.

> In order to bring the Web up to speed with encryption, the Linux Foundation along with the Electronic Frontier Foundation and many others created LetsEncrypt. LetsEncrypt is a project designed to allow users access to free SSL certificates for their websites. To date, LetsEncrypt has issued millions of certificates and is a resounding success.
