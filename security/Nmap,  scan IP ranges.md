Scanning IP ranges with Nmap (Network Mapper) network scanner is easy thanks to Nmapâ€™s flexibility. You can scan single targets, whole subnets, partial subnets, file lists with targets, you can even instruct Nmap to generate random targets, or to discover possible targets within a network based on specific conditions or arbitrarily. This tutorial focuses on all these methods.
