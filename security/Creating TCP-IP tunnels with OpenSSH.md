The typical function of the Secure Shell (SSH) network protocol is to access a remote system in terminal mode and execute commands there safely, because the data is encrypted. In addition, through this secure data connection, it is possible to create tunnels ( port forwarding ) between the connected ends so that the TCP / IP connections are channeled through the SSH connection so that we can get away with any Firewall or port blocking whenever we have the possibility to connect with SSH.
