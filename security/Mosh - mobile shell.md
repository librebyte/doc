Remote terminal application that allows roaming, supports intermittent connectivity, and provides intelligent local echo and line editing of user keystrokes.

**Mosh** is a replacement for interactive SSH terminals. It's more robust and responsive, especially over Wi-Fi, cellular, and long-distance links.

**Mosh** is free software, available for GNU/Linux, BSD, macOS, Solaris, Android, Chrome, and iOS.
