> FirewallD is a firewall management tool available by default on CentOS 7 servers. Basically, it is a wrapper around iptables and it comes with graphical configuration tool firewall-config and command line tool firewall-cmd. With the iptables service, every change requires flushing of the old rules and reading the new rules from the `/etc/sysconfig/iptables` file, while with firewalld only differences are applied.
