**Gravitational Teleport** is a modern SSH server for remotely accessing clusters of Linux servers via SSH or HTTPS. It is intended to be used instead of sshd for organizations who need:

* SSH audit with session recording/replay.
* Easily manage SSH trust between teams, organizations and data centers.
* SSH into behind-firewall clusters without any open ports.
* Role-based access control (RBAC) for SSH protocol.
