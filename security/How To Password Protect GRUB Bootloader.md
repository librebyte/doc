There is an old adage “boot access==root access”. I fully concur with this fact. Any one who can access the boot loader can also get the root access to your system easily. We already have posted a guide that described how to reset root password in Linux. That tutorial has taught you how to easily reset or recover root user password via Grub bootloader.
