> I’ll demonstrates usage of both the classic firewall-cmd command as well as the newer firewallctl command line interfaces. You can compare the syntax of the two and use the one you prefer. You can also apply the concepts discussed in this tutorial from the firewall-config GUI program. Variable values will be quoted in all examples, although it’s not strictly required to quote these as used in the example commands.
