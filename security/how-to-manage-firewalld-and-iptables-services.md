Tecmint explains how to enable/disable, start/stop FirewallD and Iptables services on CentOS/Fedora RHEL
FirewallD provides a dynamically managed firewall with support for network/firewall zones to define the trust level of network connections or interfaces. It has support for IPv4, IPv6 firewall settings and for ethernet bridges and has a separation of runtime and permanent configuration options. It also supports an interface for services or applications to add firewall rules directly.
iptables  and  ip6tables  are  used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IPv4 and IPv6 packet filter rules in the Linux kernel.
