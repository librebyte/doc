I do not recommend to disable the firewall on server but if you are doing some testing then you can disable using the following command:

Type the following command in your console

```$ sudo systemctl disable firewalld.service```

You can view the service status with:

```
$ systemctl status firewalld.service
‚óè firewalld.service - firewalld - dynamic firewall daemon
Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/firewalld.service; disabled; vendor p
Active: inactive (dead)
Docs: man:firewalld(1)
```
