> This guide is based on a minimal CentOS 7 install following the idea that you only install software that you require.

> For those familiar with OpenSCAP, you will notice the guide divided into two major sections: System Settings and Services. The first part contains rules that check system settings, where the second part is aimed towards hardening services.
