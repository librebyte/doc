> These are advanced configuration knobs that admins can set to do unusual things that are not recommended. There is no UI to enable these, and no such thing is planned. These registry keys may also be removed at some point in the future. The uninstaller will clean up the entirety of `HKLM\Software\WireGuard`. Use at your own risk, and please make sure you know what you're doing.
