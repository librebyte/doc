**SSHGuard** is an intrusion prevention utility that parses logs and automatically blocks misbehaving IP addresses (or their subnets) with the system firewall. SSHGuard version 2.1 was just released with new blocking services, the ability to block a configurable-sized subnet, and better log reading capabilities.
