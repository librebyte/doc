> There are many helpful lists maintained online with constantly-updated hosts files that contain the domains of various Internet crap peddlers. Copying these lists into your hosts file can easily block a large number of domains that your system would be better off unable to connect to. This method works without installing a browser plug-in and will handle blocking for any browser (and any other program) on the system.
