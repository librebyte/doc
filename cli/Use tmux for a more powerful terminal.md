> The tmux utility gets its name from being a terminal muxer, or multiplexer. In other words, it can break your single terminal session into multiple sessions. It manages both windows and panes:

> * A window is a single view â€” that is, an assortment of things shown in your terminal.
> * A pane is one part of that view, often a terminal session.
