Rsync is a fast and versatile file synchronization tool that allows to copy and sync files locally and from rsync service or any device that supports remote shell (Rsync does not support synchronization between remote devices). Rsync offers a large number of options that control every aspect of its behaviour and permit very flexible specification of the set of files to be copied.
