> Whether it’s a server administrator or a programmer some time we need to refer multiple logfiles for effectively troubleshooting tasks. To achieve this we have to open, tail or less a each logfile in a different shell. However, we can use traditional tail command like tail -f /var/log/messages or tail -f /var/log/secure in a single line. But if we want to see multiple files in a real-time we need to install a specific tool called MultiTail.

**MultiTail** allows you to monitor logfiles and command output in multiple windows in a terminal, colorize, filter and merge.
