> For years I’ve stored my passwords in Firefox, because it’s convenient, and I never bothered with all those other fancy password managers. The problem is, that it locked me into Firefox and I found myself still needing to remember passwords for servers and things.

> So a few months ago I decided to give command line tool Pass a try.

> With pass, each password lives inside of a gpg encrypted file whose filename is the title of the website or resource that requires the password.
