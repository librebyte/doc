 **Tmate** will establish a secure connection over SSH to tmate.io website and generate a random URL for each session. You can share the URL with someone you trust and they can use the Terminal as the way they use their own Terminal as long as the connection is active. It is best for collaborating on common projects, or debugging a project with a team of developers, or getting a technical support over remote network.
