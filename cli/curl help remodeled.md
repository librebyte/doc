curl 4.8 was released in 1998 and contained 46 command line options. `curl --help` would list them all. A decent set of options.

When we released curl 7.72.0 a few weeks ago, it contained 232 optionsâ€¦ and `curl --help` still listed all available options.

What was once a long list of options grew over the decades into a crazy long wall of text shock to users who would enter this command and option, thinking they would figure out what command line options to try next.
