> Screen is a very useful command that offers the ability to use multiple shell windows (sessions) from a single SSH session. When the session is detached or there is a network disruption, the process that is started in a screen session will still run and you can re-attach to the screen session at any time. This also comes in handy if you want to run a long process persistently or connect to shell sessions from multiple locations.
