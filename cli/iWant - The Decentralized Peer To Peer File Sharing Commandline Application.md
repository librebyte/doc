> A while ago, we have written a guide about transfer.sh and that allows you to share files over Internet easily and quickly, and PSiTransfer –  a simple open source self-hosted file sharing solution. Today, we will see yet another file sharing utility called “iWant”. It is a free and open source CLI-based decentralized peer to peer file sharing application.
