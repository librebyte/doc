Two days back we had written an article about autocd. It’s a builtin shell variable that helps us to navigate to inside a directory without cd command.

If you want to come back to previous directory then you have to type cd ...

If you want to go back to two directories then you have to type cd ../...

It’s normal in Linux but if you want to come back from 9th directory to 3rd directory, then it’s horrible to use cd command. 

What will be the solution for this.
