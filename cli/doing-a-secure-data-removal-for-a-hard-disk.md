In this tutorial nixCraft explains how to delete data permanently from a hard disk using a live CD.

> The secure removal of data is not as easy as you may think. When you delete a file using the default commands of the operating system (for example “rm” in Linux/BSD/MacOS/UNIX or “del” in DOS or emptying the recycle bin in WINDOWS) the operating system does NOT delete the file, the contents of the file remains on your hard disk.
