**Sismo** is a Continuous Testing Server written in PHP.

**Sismo** does not try to do more than getting your code, running your tests, and send you notifications.

**Sismo** is language and tool agnostic. Just give it a command that knows how to run your tests and returns a non-zero exit code when tests do not pass.
