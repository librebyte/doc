Sysbox is an open-source container runtime (aka runc), originally developed by Nestybox, that enables Docker containers to act as virtual servers capable of running software such as Systemd, Docker, and Kubernetes in them, easily and with proper isolation. This allows you to use containers in new ways, and provides a faster, more efficient, and more portable alternative to virtual machines in many scenarios.
