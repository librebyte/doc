**Cockpit** makes it easy to administer your GNU/Linux servers via a web browser.
**Features:**

* Easy to use. Cockpit makes GNU/Linux discoverable, allowing sysadmins to easily perform tasks such as starting containers, storage administration, network configuration, inspecting logs and so on.
* No interference. Jumping between the terminal and the web tool is no problem. A service started via Cockpit can be stopped via the terminal. Likewise, if an error occurs in the terminal, it can be seen in the Cockpit journal interface.
* Multi-server. You can monitor and administer several servers at the same time. Just add it easily and your server will look after its buddies.
