Automate and streamline your build-test-release cycle for reliable, continuous delivery of your product with GoCD.

**Features:**

- Model complex workflows: With its parallel and sequential execution, GoCD can easily configure dependencies for fast feedback and on-demand deployment. Its fan-in/fan-out dependency management always does the "right thing," avoiding spurious builds.
- Easily compare builds: GoCD's ability to compare content - both files and commit messages - across any two arbitrary builds, makes it invaluable when troubleshooting a broken pipeline.
- Clearly visualize your workflow: GoCD's Value Stream Map visualizes your end-to-end workflow in real time. Every change can be tracked from commit to deploy and back again.
