Ansible Inventories are complex in the following ways:

*  After you have decided an Inventory model is hard to change it, in fact you would probably be required to touch all your Playbooks to make everything working again
* There is not a single way of doing Inventories
* Often Inventories are the glue to make a generic Playbook run properly on your specific architecture.
