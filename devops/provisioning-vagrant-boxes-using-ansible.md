In this article, we will see how we can use Ansible to provision Vagrant boxes.

So, what exactly is a Vagrant box? In simple terms, we can think of a vagrant box as a virtual machine prepackaged with the development tools we require to run our development environment. our development environment. We can use these boxes to distribute the development environment which the other team members can use to work on the projects. Using Ansible, we can automate the task of provisioning the
Vagrant boxes with our development packages. So, letâ€™s see how we can do this.

**Ansible** is a radically simple IT automation engine that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration, and many other IT needs.

**Vagrant** is a tool for building complete development environments. With an easy-to-use workflow and focus on automation, Vagrant lowers development environment setup time, increases development/production parity, and makes the "works on my machine" excuse a relic of the past.
