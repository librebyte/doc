> Prometheus is a next-generation open source monitoring system from SoundCloud and is designed for monitoring such as the generation and collection of metrics, graphing the resulting data on dashboards, and alerting on anomalies etc. In this tutorial we will install/configure following components -

* Prometheus as a Docker service although it can be installed as a binary or built from source.
* Prometheus Node Exporter which exposes the metrics of the host machine.
* Grafana the face of Prometheus.
* Prometheus alertmanager which will generate alerts based on some criteria and send it to email, hipchat, slacks etc.
* cAdvisior - collects, aggregates, processes, and exports information about running containers.
