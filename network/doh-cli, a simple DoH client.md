 A couple months ago, we announced a public and free DNS service, so people can have encrypted DNS in their browsers and systems. We support both DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over TLS and our DoH service has two endpoints, the default /dns-query and one for blocking trackers and ads /ads. You can visit our page for more info.
