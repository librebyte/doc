Freelan is a free, open-source, multi-platform, peer-to-peer VPN software that abstracts a LAN over the Internet. It works on Windows, Linux and Mac OSX.

Freelan allows you to create any kind of network topology you like: from the classical clients-server schema, to the completely crazy hybrid peer-to-peer decentralized graph.
