**ncat** or **nc** is networking utility with functionality similar to cat command but for network. It  is a general purpose CLI tool for reading, writing, redirecting data across a network. It is  designed to be a reliable back-end tool that can be used with scripts or other programs.  Itâ€™s also a great tool for network debugging, as it can create any kind of connect one can need.
