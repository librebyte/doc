Take back the power… and the responsibilities! PeerTube isn’t a single video hosting platform with a single group of rules: it’s a network of dozens of interconnected hosting providers, and each provider is composed of different people and administrators. You don’t like some of the rules? You’re free to join the hosting provider of your choice, or even better, be your own hosting provider with your own rules!
