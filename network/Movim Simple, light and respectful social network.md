Movim features:

* Movim's [source code](https://github.com/edhelas/movim) is completely open allowing anyone to study how it works to improve it, share it and redistribute it freely.
* Movim is based on a fully decentralized and standard network.
* Since the beginning all the Movim communications are made using XMPP.
