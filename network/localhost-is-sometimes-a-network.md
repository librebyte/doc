> Everyone knows localhost, 127.0.0.1, the IP(v4) address of every machine's loopback network. If you're talking to 127.0.0.1, you're talking to yourself (machine-wise). Many of us (although not all) know that localhost is not just a single IP address; instead, all of 127.*.*.* (aka 127/8) is reserved as the loopback network.
