> In this tutorial, I will show you how to configure an additional domain controller which is one of the key features of SAMBA 4. I will be using the existing Samba 4 server from my previous tutorial as primary domain controller. This setup provides a degree of load balancing and failover for AD services (Ldap schemas and dns ) and configuring it is really easy. We can also use this feature to scale up the environment.
