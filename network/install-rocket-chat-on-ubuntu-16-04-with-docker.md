> Rocket.Chat is a Web Chat Server, developed in JavaScript. It is an open source messaging APP built with Meteor fullstack framework. It is a great solution for communities and companies who need to host their own private chat service or for developers who're planning to build and evolve their own chat platforms.

**Docker** provides an integrated technology suite that enables development and IT operations teams to build, ship, and run distributed applications anywhere.
