**ZeroNet** uses Bitcoin cryptography and BitTorrent technology to build a decentralized censorship-resistant network.

Users can publish static or dynamic websites into ZeroNet and visitors can choose to also serve the website. Websites will remain online even if it is being served by only one peer.

When a site is updated by its owner, all nodes serving that site (previous visitors) will receive only the incremental updates done to the site content.
