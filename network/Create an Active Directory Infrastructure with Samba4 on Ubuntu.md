> Samba can operate as a standalone file and print server for Windows and Linux clients through the SMB/CIFS protocol suite or can act as an Active Directory Domain Controller or joined into a Realm as a Domain Member. The highest AD DC domain and forest level that currently Samba4 can emulate is Windows 2008 R2.
