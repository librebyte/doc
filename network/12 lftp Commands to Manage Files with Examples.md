> Today we are going to install LFTP, which is a command line FTP client. LFTP supports many protocols in addition to FTP, such as HTTP, HTTPS, HFTP, FISH, FTPS and FXP. It supports mirroring directories and you can have commands entered in two modes. In LFTP command line shell or right from the bash shell. The latter one is particularity useful if you are going to write a script that uses LFTP.
