> Varnish is a caching daemon that sits between your visitors and the web daemon itself. For every request that comes in, it looks if it already retrieved a cached version of that page.

> If it does, it serves that; if it doesnâ€™t, it will request the page from the backend web server, serve that to the visitor, and cache the page for when the next visitor comes by requesting the same page.
