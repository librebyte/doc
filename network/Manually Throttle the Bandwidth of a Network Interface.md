In complex service oriented application stacks, some bugs only manifest themselves on congested or slow networking interfaces. Consider a web-service running on a generic Linux box with a single networking interface, eth0. If eth0 is busy enough to completely saturate its networking link, a web-service running on the host behind that link may experience odd behavior when things "slowdown".
