> Unbound is a validating, recursive, and caching DNS server. Having said that, Unbound DNS server cannot be used as an authoritative DNS server, which means it cannot be used to host custom domain name records. As a result, if your goal is to build a cache-only or forwarding DNS server, Unbound may be your preferred choice, as it does just that and it does it well.
