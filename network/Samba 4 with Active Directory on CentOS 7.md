> In the last tutorial, I showed you how to configure Samba on Centos 7 by compiling Samba from source since the package supplied by RedHat doesn't support Active Directory. I noticed that there is a repository called Wing which supplies the samba4 rpm with AD support. In this tutorial, I will be using this repository for Samba installation. I will also show how to create a samba share.
