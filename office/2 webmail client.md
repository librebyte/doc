[Cypht](https://cypht.org/) is an application built entirely of plugins, or as we call them, module sets (which is obviously way cooler sounding than plugins), that are executed by the framework. Modules provide a flexible way to add new features or customize the program without hacking the code.

[WebMail Lite](https://www.afterlogic.org/webmail-lite) has a minimalistic interface is combined with a rich feature set, no tradeoffs here. Built on the latest HTML5 and CSS3 technology. Install it on your web servers for personal or commercial use, redistribute, integrate with other software, or alter the source code (provided that you contribute your changes back to the community).
