With **Joplin** you can write your notes in the Markdown format (with support for math notations and checkboxes) and the desktop app comes with 3 views: Markdown code, Markdown preview, or both side by side. You can add attachments to your notes (with image previews) or edit them in an external Markdown editor and have them automatically updated in Joplin each time you save the file.
