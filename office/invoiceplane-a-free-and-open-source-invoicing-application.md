The main idea behind the **InvoicePlane** software is the creation of an application you host on your own server and use it for basic invoicing and client management.
**Goals:**

* Keep InvoicePlane a free and open source software.
* Provide updates on a regular base.
* Maintain a clean and hassle-free interface that is easy to learn and use.
* Offer a lot of functions and features while trying not to overload the application.
* Make configuration and customization as easy as possible.
* Keep the requirements low so InvoicePlane can also be used within older environments.
