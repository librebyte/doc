Keyboard shortcuts are quick key combinations that replace mouse navigation. For example, rather than using the mouse to navigate the menu structure to archive a message, you can simply strike the "A" key while a message is highlighted in the message list. Some shortcuts can be customized or disabled with the use of an add-on.
