**Anbox** is a new open source system that lets you run Android apps on a PC natively, as if they were desktop applications. There’s no emulation required.

That’s because Anbox is designed to run on GNU/Linux distributions such as Ubuntu or Fedora, using the same Linux kernel for both the host operating system and for Android.
