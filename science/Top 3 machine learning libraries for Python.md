> In this article, I'll look at three of the most popular machine learning libraries for Python.

> Theano: Released nearly a decade ago and primarily developed by a machine learning group at Université de Montréal, Theano is one of the most-used CPU and GPU mathematical compilers in the machine learning community.

> TensorFlow: TensorFlow, an open source library for numerical computing using data flow graphs, is a newcomer to the world of open source, but this Google-led project already has almost 15,000 commits and more than 600 contributors on GitHub, and nearly 12,000 stars on its models repository.

> scikit-learn: Built on NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, scikit-learn (pronounced sy-kit learn) is used by Spotify engineers for music recommendations, at OkCupid to help evaluate and improve their matchmaking system, and during the exploration phase of new product development at Birchbox.
