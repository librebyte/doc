- **P-Brain** uses natural language processing to turn your query into an actionable command. Just like humans do!
- With javascript being one of the most accesible technologies available, it was a no-brainer for P-Brain to be written in it.
- Extend what P-Brain.ai can do with simple javascript skills that once built, can be installed with a simple drag-n-drop into the 'skills folder'.
