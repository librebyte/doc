* **Bots:** Easily create text or voice based bots that humans can chat with on their preferred messaging platform.
* **Mobile apps:** Users enjoy a hands-free mobile experience while driving, working out, cooking. Developers use Wit to easily build a voice interface for their app.
* **Home automation:** Users are sitting on their couch, and the remote is out of reach. Wit invokes Home.set_temperature() on the thermostat if they say they are feeling hot.
* **Wearable devices:** Wearable devices come with tiny screens. Wit enables not only the maker of the device, but also its ecosystem of developers, to build their must-have voice interface.
* **Hardware:** Wit not only enables your hardware to understand humans, it also helps you discover their unforeseen needs.
