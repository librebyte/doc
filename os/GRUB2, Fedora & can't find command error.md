> The problem you are facing is as follows. You have a multi-boot system with several instances of different operating systems, mostly Linux. You have recently installed a Red Hat distro, like Fedora, the Fedora derivative Chapeau, CentOS or alike, and you want it to be in charge of the GRUB2 bootloader sequence. So far so good.

> However, when you try to boot an entry other than the above distro, you get a weird error that says: error: can't find command 'linux' and error: can't find command 'initrd'. This effectively breaks your system. What now? Let's fix it.
