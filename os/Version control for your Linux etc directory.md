Your /etc/ directory is where most Linux distributions store your system's configuration files, and tracking /etc/ has some extra challenges beyond what a version control system tracks. Etckeeper helps us with those extra requirements. Etckeeper prefers git, but also works with several other version control systems: mercurial, bazaar, or darcs.
