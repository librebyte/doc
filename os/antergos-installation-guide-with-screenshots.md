Today, we will show you how to install Antergos, an Arch based distribution that comes with a graphical installer to make the installation much easier for newbies.

**Antergos** is a rolling release distribution. Your entire system, from the base OS components to the applications that you install, will receive updates as they are released upstreamâ€”with only a minimal delay to ensure stability.
The purpose of Antergos is to provide a modern, elegant, and powerful operating system based on one of the best Linux distributions available, Arch Linux.
