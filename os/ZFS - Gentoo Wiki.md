ZFS is a next generation filesystem created by Matthew Ahrens and Jeff Bonwick. It was designed around a few key ideas:

- Administration of storage should be simple.
- Redundancy should be handled by the filesystem.
- File-systems should never be taken offline for repair.
- Automated simulations of worst case scenarios before shipping code is important.
- Data integrity is paramount.
