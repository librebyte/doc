> What are snaps and why you should use them? The Linux ecosystem has suffered from an old problem since the dawn of the concept of 'distribution', and that problem is fragmentation. One of the biggest issues that cause this fragmentation is different package formats; I can't run my .debs on my Fedora system or my .rpms on my Ubuntu machine.

**Snapcraft** helps you assemble a whole project in a single tree out of many pieces. It can drive a very wide range of build and packaging systems, so that you can simply list all the upstream projects you want and have them built and installed together as a single tree.
