> Swap is used to give processes room, even when the physical RAM of the system is already used up. In a normal system configuration, when a system faces memory pressure, swap is used, and later when the memory pressure disappears and the system returns to normal operation, swap is no longer used. In this typical situation, swap helped through the time of memory shortage, at the cost of reduced performance while swapping.
