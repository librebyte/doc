Linux I/O Scheduler is a process of accessing the block I/O from storage volumes. I/O scheduling is sometimes called disk scheduling.  Linux I/O scheduler works by managing a block deviceâ€™s request queue. It selects the order of requests in the queue and at what time each request is sent to the block device. Linux I/O Scheduler manages the request queue with the goal of reducing seeks, which results in great extent for global throughput.
