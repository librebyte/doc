> The problem you are facing is as follows. You have decided to update your GRUB2 menu configuration. The execution of the command seems to hang or take a very long time, and optionally, you may decide to try to break it. At this point, you see a lot of errors on your screen, reading something like: rmdir: failed to remove '/var/lib/os-prober/mount': Device or resource busy.
