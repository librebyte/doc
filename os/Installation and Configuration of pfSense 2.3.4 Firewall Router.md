PfSense is a FreeBSD based open source firewall solution. The distribution is free to install on oneâ€™s own equipment or the company behind pfSense, NetGate, sells pre-configured firewall appliances. The required hardware for pfSense is very minimal and typically an older home tower can easily be re-purposed into a dedicated pfSense Firewall.
