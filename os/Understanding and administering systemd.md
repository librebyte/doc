Systemd is a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with SysV and LSB init scripts. Systemd provides:

- Aggressive parallelization capabilities
- Uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services
- Offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups
- Supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state
- Maintains mount and automount points
- Implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic.
