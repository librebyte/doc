Parabola GNU/Linux-libre is a 100% free distribution powered by Linux-libre (Linux-libre is a variant of Linux kernel without  binary blobs). Parabola is based on Arch Linux and it's in the list of [Free GNU/Linux distributions](https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html) recommended by The FSF.

The Parabola project is a community driven effort to provide a fully Free (as in freedom) operating system that is simple and lightweight.
