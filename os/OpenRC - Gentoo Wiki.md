OpenRC is a dependency-based init system that maintains compatibility with the system provided init program, normally located in /sbin/init. It does not function as a replacement for the /sbin/init file. OpenRC is 100% compatible with Gentoo init scripts, which means a solution can be found to run the dozens of daemons in the main Gentoo repository. OpenRC, however, is not designed to be exclusively used by Gentoo Linux and can be used on other distributions and BSD systems.
