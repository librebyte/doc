> In Linux and other Unix-like systems, there are three default files named below which are also identified by the shell using file descriptor numbers:

> - stdin or 0 – it’s connected to the keyboard, most programs read input from this file.

> - stdout or 1 – it’s attached to the screen, and all programs send their results to this file and

> - stderr or 2 – programs send status/error messages to this file which is also attached to the screen.
