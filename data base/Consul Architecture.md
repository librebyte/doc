> In this blog post, I’ll provide my thoughts about Consul for ProxySQL service discovery and automation. Consul consists of a single, small binary (the Linux binary is 24MB). You just download it, edit the configuration file and start the program. It doesn’t need a package. The Consul binary does it all. You can start it as a server or as a client. It also provides a set of administrative tasks, usable via the command-line or the HTTP API.
