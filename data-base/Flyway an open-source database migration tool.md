**Flyway** is an open-source database migration tool. It strongly favors simplicity and convention over configuration. It is based around just 6 basic commands: Migrate, Clean, Info, Validate, Baseline and Repair.

Migrations can be written in SQL (database-specific syntax (such as PL/SQL, T-SQL, ...) is supported) or Java (for advanced data transformations or dealing with LOBs).
