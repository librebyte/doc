Krunal Bauskar provides a guide for "MySQL High Availability with Percona  Cluster 5.7". Here are some of the questions covered:

* How is storage distribution done across the node?
* If write-set propagation fails in some manner is there any retry mechanism?
* Would it be possible to get more information about setting up proxy-sql as we are currently using haproxy but would like a more aware balancer.
