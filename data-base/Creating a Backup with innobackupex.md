**innobackupex** is the tool which provides functionality to backup a whole MySQL database instance using the xtrabackup in combination with tools like xbstream and xbcrypt.

To create a full backup, invoke the script with the options needed to connect to the server and only one argument: the path to the directory where the backup will be stored
