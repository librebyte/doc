MariaDB Galera is a multi-master cluster for MariaDB. Since MariaDB 10.1, the MariaDB Server and MariaDB Galera Server packages have been combined and Galera packages and their dependencies get installed automatically when installing MariaDB. Currently, MariaDB Galera Cluster only supports the InnoDB/XtraDB storage engine.
