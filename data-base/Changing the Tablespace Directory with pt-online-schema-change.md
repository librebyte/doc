> One of the most annoying situations in the life of a DBA is realizing that the disk where the datadir resides is running out of space. If youâ€™re lucky enough to run over an LVM volume or a RAID (depending on the level, though), it is easy to add disk space. But what if you are not that lucky, and your datadir is running on a single disk? Not so funny!
