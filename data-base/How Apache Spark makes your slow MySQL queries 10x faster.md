> Using Apache Spark on top of the existing MySQL server(s) (without the need to export or even stream data to Spark or Hadoop), we can increase query performance more than ten times. Using multiple MySQL servers (replication or Percona XtraDB Cluster) gives us an additional performance increase for some queries. You can also use the Spark cache function to cache the whole MySQL query results table.
