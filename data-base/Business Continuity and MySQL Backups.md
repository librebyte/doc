> This blog post discusses the business continuity plan around MySQL backups, and how organizations should think about them.

> During the years I’ve worked in IT, I’ve learned that backups sometimes are a conceptual subject in organizations. Many companies have them, but don’t document the associated business continuation plan for them. I experienced this the hard way many many years ago, somewhere around when MySQL 5.0 was still widely used.
