> In this tutorial, I will describe how to configure HttpGzipModule on a nginx web server (on Debian Jessie). HttpGzipModule allows nginx to compress files and deliver them to clients (e.g. browsers) that can handle compressed content which most modern browsers do. With HttpGzipModule, you can compress HTML, CSS, Javascript, text or XML files to approx. 20 - 30% of their original sizes, thus saving you server traffic and making your modem users happier.
