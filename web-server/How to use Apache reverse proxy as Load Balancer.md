Reverse proxy is a kind of a proxy that takes http or https request & transfers/distributes them to one or more backend servers. Reverse proxy is useful in many ways, like
 
* It can hide the origin serve, thus making it more secure & immune to attacks,
* It can act as a load balancer,
* Reverse proxy can also be used to encrypting/decrypting webserver traffic, thus taking some load off from the backend servers.
* It can also be used for caching static as well as dynamic contents, which also reduces load off the web servers.
