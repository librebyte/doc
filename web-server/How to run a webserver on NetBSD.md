**bozohttpd** is a small and secure HTTP 1.1 server shipped with NetBSD (/usr/libexec/httpd) by default. It's very simple and there isn't even a configuration file. But it only provides the most basic features.

**The Apache HTTP** server is a widely-used open source HTTP server. Apache is a powerful HTTP server, which can be extended by loading dynamic shared object (DSO).
