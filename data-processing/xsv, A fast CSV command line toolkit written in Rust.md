**xsv** is a command line program for indexing, slicing, analyzing, splitting and joining CSV files. Commands should be simple, fast and composable:

1. Simple tasks should be easy.
2. Performance trade offs should be exposed in the CLI interface.
3. Composition should not come at the expense of performance.
