This tutorial describes how to setup centralized Rsyslog server on CentOS 7 to manage the logs of your client systems from a common place. You donâ€™t have to visit the client systems when you want to check the log files of your client systems. This can be useful if you have large number of systems on your network and want to do the log management from a centralized dedicated log server.
