*GoatCounter*

Simple web statistics. No tracking of personal data.

Lightweight and fast; adds just 1.8KB of extra data to your site.

Easy; if you've been confused by the myriad of options and flexibility of Google Analytics and Matomo that you don't need then GoatCounter will be a breath of fresh air.

Accessibility is a high-priority feature, and the interface works well with assistive technology such as screen readers.

100% committed to open source; you can see exactly what the code does and make improvements. See the GitHub page.
