**Fio** which stands for Flexible I/O Tester is a free and open source disk I/O tool used both for benchmark and stress/hardware verification developed by Jens Axboe.

It has support for 19 different types of I/O engines (sync, mmap, libaio, posixaio, SG v3, splice, null, network, syslet, guasi, solarisaio, and more), I/O priorities (for newer Linux kernels), rate I/O, forked or threaded jobs, and much more. It can work on block devices as well as files.
