> The WordPress Customizer has been actively developed since its inception. The APIs are continually evolving, including the JavaScript API. We can stretch the API to, for example, hide, show, or move a Section, Panel, a Control, change the value of a Setting based on another Setting value, and interconnect the Preview and the Control interactions. And these are what we are going to look into in this tutorial.
