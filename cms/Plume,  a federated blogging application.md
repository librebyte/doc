Write once, publish everywhere  Plume is not just a single website, but an entire interconnected, yet independent network of what we call instances. You write content from your own instance, but anyone else on any other Plume instance can enjoy your stories too.

Social blogging  When we write, it is, most of the time, to share something with other people. Plume has many features that allow the exchange between writers and readers to be bi-directional from the get-go.
