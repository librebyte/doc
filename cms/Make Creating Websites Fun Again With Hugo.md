> Static sites are popular for many reasons. Avoiding overkill solutions and keeping a project simple without databases, too many dependencies, or specific server-side configurations (no PHP, no MySQL/MSSQL, .NET, Python, Ruby, and so on) make it very simple to deploy and be robust against numerous possible vulnerabilities. Ultimately, these become basic HTML pages served to the user.

> In this guide, I will show you how to setup your development environment with Hugo and build your first static Hugo website.
