 > Most modern workstation and server mainboards contain an integrated, network-enabled auxiliary controller called the "Baseboard Management Controller", or BMC. This controller typically allows "lights-out" remote management of the server platform (i.e. power control via IPMI independent of the host operating system or hardware status), as well as handling basic management functions required for proper mainboard operation.
