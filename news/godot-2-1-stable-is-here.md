Godot engine Development Team is proud to release the marvellous Godot Engine 2.1. Just like 2.0, this version focuses exclusively on further improving usability and the editor interface. This release marks the conclusion of a series focusing on usability improvements.
Godot is an advanced, feature-packed, multi-platform 2D and 3D open source game engine. Godot provides a huge set of common tools, so you can just focus on making your game without reinventing the wheel. Godot is completely free and open source under the very permissive MIT license.
