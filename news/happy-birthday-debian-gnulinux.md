The Debian Project was officially founded by Ian Murdock on 1993-08-16. The Debian Community celebrates its birthday, Debian Day, on this day each year. (It has also been called Debian Appreciation Day.)
Debian is a free operating system (OS) for your computer. An operating system is the set of basic programs and utilities that make your computer run.
