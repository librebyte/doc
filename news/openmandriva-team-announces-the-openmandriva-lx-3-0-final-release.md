The OpenMandriva team is proud to release OpenMandriva Lx 3.0 final release.

**Hightlights**

OpenMandriva Lx is a cutting edge distribution compiled with LLVM/clang. Combined with the high level of optimisation this gives the OpenMandriva desktop an unbelievably crisp response to operations on the KDE Plasma 5 desktop which makes it a pleasure to use.
