In this introduction to free software licensing, we will cover the most common issues free software projects confront when it comes to licensing. At the Free Software Foundation's Licensing & Compliance Lab, we have many opportunities to help developers correct and update their licensing. Whether we're answering questions from the community, helping maintainers get their project listed in the Free Software Directory, or handling compliance issues on behalf of the GNU Project, we run across a wide variety of common mistakes and misunderstandings. In this brief session, we'll address these common problems as well as demonstrate the proper way to license your project.
