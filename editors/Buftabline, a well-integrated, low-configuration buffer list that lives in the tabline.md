If you donâ€™t know anything about buffers, the minimum you have to know is that a buffer in Vim essentially means a file, and if you set hidden, Vim can keep files open without necessarily displaying them on screen. You can then use the :bnext and :bprev commands to change which buffer is being displayed in the current window, and :ls to look at the list of buffers.
