> Did you ever wonder if there is a text editor that can do anything almost like a complete operating system? That text editor is GNU Emacs. Emacs is truly lightweight (console is its default interface), long-living (since 1976; 40 years ago), extensible, advanced, very general purpose, and Emacs makes the user types very fast as an Emacs user ever said "you type on Emacs as fast as you think". As a text editor, Emacs can do any basic text editing, edit source code for any programming language, do multitasking such as writing while compiling, and more.
