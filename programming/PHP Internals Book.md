This book is a collaborative effort between several developers of the PHP language to better document and describe how PHP works internally.

There are three primary goals of this book:

- Document and describe how PHP internals work.
- Document and describe how to extend the language with extensions.
- Document and describe how you can interact with the community to develop PHP itself.
