Understanding the Input/Output (I/O) model of your application can mean the difference between an application that deals with the load it is subjected to, and one that crumples in the face of real-world use cases. Perhaps while your application is small and does not serve high loads, it may matter far less. But as your applicationâ€™s traffic load increases, working with the wrong I/O model can get you into a world of hurt.
