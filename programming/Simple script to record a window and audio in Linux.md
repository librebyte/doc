Simple script to record a window and audio in Linux
Works fine on X Window System for years, you asked, here you go. Will probably not work on Wayland, I havenâ€™t tried. Tell me about it if you use it.

For the record, the script asks you to click on a window and then it starts recording it in slow frames per second with audio from the default device.
