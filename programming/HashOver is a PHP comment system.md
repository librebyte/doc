**HashOver** is a PHP comment system intended as a replacement for services like Disqus. HashOver is free/libre software, release under the GNU Affero General Public License.  HashOver adds a "comment section" to any website, by placing a few simple lines of JavaScript or PHP to the source code of any webpage. HashOver is a self-hosted system and allows completely anonymous comments to be posted, the only required information is the comment itself.
