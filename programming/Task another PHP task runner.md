Got a PHP project? Heard of Grunt and Gulp but don't use NodeJS? Task is a pure PHP task runner.

* Leverage PHP as a scripting language, and as your platform of choice.
* Use loads of nice features inspired by Grunt and Gulp (and Phing).
* Employ Symfony components for effortless CLI goodness.
* Extend with plugins.
