**Surf** is a Go (golang) library that implements a virtual web browser that you control programmatically. Surf isn't just another Go solution for downloading content from the web. Surf is designed to behave like web browser, and includes: cookie management, history, bookmarking, user agent spoofing (with a nifty user agent builder), submitting forms, DOM selection and traversal via jQuery style CSS selectors, scraping assets like images, stylesheets, and other features.
