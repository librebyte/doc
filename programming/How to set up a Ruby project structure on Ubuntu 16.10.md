> For about two months now I’ve been learning how to code in Ruby using Learn Ruby the Hard Way. Never mind the title, but it’s actually a very good resource for learning how to program in Ruby. The last few exercises that I’ve gone through could have been written better, but overall, it’s a good book for those just getting into the world of software coding.
