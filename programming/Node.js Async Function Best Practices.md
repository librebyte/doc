async functions let you write Promise-based code as if it were synchronous. Once you define a function using the async keyword, then you can use the await keyword within the functionâ€™s body. When the async function is called, it returns with a Promise. When the async function returns a value, the Promise gets fulfilled, if the async function throws an error, it gets rejected.
