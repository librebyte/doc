**Loopback** is a highly extensible open-source Node.js framework that can be used to build dynamic end-to-end REST APIs. With little or no code, **Loopback** hands you the power to:

* Quickly create APIs.
* Connect your APIs to data sources such as relational databases, MongoDB, REST APIs, etc.
* Incorporate model relationships and access controls for complex APIs.
* Extend your APIs.
