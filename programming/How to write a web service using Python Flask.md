Specifically, I'm going to walk through the creation of a simple Python Flask app that provides a RESTful web service. The service will provide an endpoint to:

* Ingest a JSON formatted payload (webhook) from Threat Stack
* Parse the payload for Threat Stack Alert IDs
* Retrieve detailed alert data from Threat Stack
