Buffalo is a Go web development eco-system, designed to make the life of a Go web developer easier.

Buffalo starts by generating a web project for you that already has everything from front-end (JavaScript, SCSS, etc...) to back-end (database, routing, etc...) already hooked up and ready to run. From there it provides easy APIs to build your web application quickly in Go.
