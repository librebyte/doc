Icicle uses Awaitables and Generators to create Coroutines, interruptible functions that use the yield keyword to define interruption points. When a Coroutine yields an Awaitable, execution of the coroutine is interrupted until the awaitable resolves.

* Multiple event loop back-ends
* Asynchronous TCP and UDP sockets
* Asynchronous DNS resolution
* Standalone HTTP and WebSocket server
